Rain is Falling
  	
Rain, rain, its always raining,
Rain, rain, I end up saying,
Rain, rain, please go away now,
Rain, rain, just leave right now,
Rain, rain, don't know how,
I don't care how,
To make my rainy day just go away...

So I stand,
in the pouring rain,
So I can,
feel the growing pain,
Of having rain,
coming down like the Armageddon flame.

I can see raindrops playing their game,
Even though they look the same,
I know that there is more to rain...
