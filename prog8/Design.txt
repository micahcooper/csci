DESIGN DOCUMENT
---------------

The application level protocol is entirely composed of an agreed upon
header paradigm.  This is built on top of UDP.  The header includes
the following information: 
	flags - this determines the actions to be taken by server and client
	sequence number - this indicates the packet number
	filename - this is the name of the file being transferred
	data length - indicates the length of data in a packet
	unique id - this is the indentifying marker to reduce unwanted packet
	data - the rest of the packet.
The total application packet size is 65500 bytes.

To increase the reliability of the UDP transport my implementation 
requires a "handshake" and attempts to control the ordered transfer of 
one packet at a time.  The server will always make a request for the 
next packet it wants.  The client will then send the requested packet,
regardless of what it last sent.
