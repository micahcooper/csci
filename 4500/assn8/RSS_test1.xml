             balmy spring weather hit this beautiful college town. Only the Computer Science majors

         <title>Artificial Intelligence Experiment leads to problems</title>
         <pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2007 13:29:00 EST</pubDate>
         <description>UGA student Lisa Lesser-Known remains under medical observation following an abortive
            attempt by Artificial Intelligence students to implant a microprocessor in her brain. Ever since
            the experiment, Ms. Lesser-Known has been walking around campus with a gait like the Munchkins from
            Wizard of Oz, singing old show tunes. Her friends are concerned, but describe her behavior as
            "normal, for Lisa anyway."

         <title>Spring training draws record crowds</title>
         <pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2007 13:34:00 EST</pubDate>
         <description> Attendance at Major League Baseball spring training games in Florida could top the 
         1.6 million record set the last two years.  Figures released Friday by the Florida Sports Foundation 
         show more than 858,000 fans have gone to Grapefruit League games at 17 ball parks statewide. Average 
         attendance for each of the 145 games played through Thursday was 5,921, with some parks getting nearly 
         twice that number for some games. The New York Yankees have maintained their state lead with average 
         attendance of 10,302 at Legends Field in Tampa. However, their biggest crowd so far this month was 
         11,049 on March 8 when they played the Atlanta Braves at Wide World of Sports. Boosting the Cactus League 
         attendance was the renewed interest in the Detroit Tigers, with 7,375 fans per game at Joker Marchant Stadium.
